## üéØ Features

- **Real-time data streaming**  
  Establishes connection to a sensor via WebSocket and displays live EMG (4 channels) & IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope) charts using Chart.js.

- **Stream recording**  
  Session data can be stopped, saved as CSV, tagged with categories, and annotated with user notes.

- **Series management**  
  Users can browse, filter, download, edit notes, and delete their recorded series. Admins can manage all users‚Äô series and categories.

- **Category administration**  
  Admins can create, edit, or delete categories (title, description, and an optional image).

- **Role-based access**  
  Two roles supported:  
  - *User*: create, view, and manage their own series  
  - *Admin*: full control including user series and category management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1. **Microcontroller ‚Üí Python TCP Bridge**  
   Listens on a socket, parses raw sensor packets, and forwards them as JSON to the Node WebSocket server.

2. **Node.js WebSocket Server**  
   Broadcasts the incoming sensor data to connected Laravel clients.

3. **Laravel Client**  
   Connects to the WebSocket server (using IP provided by the user), visualizes real-time charts, and buffers data locally.

4. **Laravel API**  
   Handles CRUD for series: create, retrieve, update notes, download CSV, delete.
